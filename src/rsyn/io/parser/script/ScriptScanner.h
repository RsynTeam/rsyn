/* From Flex documentation:
 *   The c++ scanner is a mess. The FlexLexer.h header file relies on the
 *   following macro. This is required in order to pass the c++-multiple-scanners
 *   test in the regression suite. We get reports that it breaks inheritance.
 *   We will address this in a future release of flex, or omit the C++ scanner
 *   altogether.
 *
 * So, for now, let's define this variable too...
